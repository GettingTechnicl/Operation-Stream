# Operation-Stream

This has only been tested on Ubuntu18.04, mileage may vary elsewhere.

This is a bash script that downloads all dependencies and installs the following applications;
Radarr, Sonarr, Deluge, Jackett, LazyLibrarian, Mylar, NzbGet, Lidarr, Ombi and sickbeard_mp4_automator.


This script is primarily designed for my usage

Currently none of the variables can be changed, if you change a variable you will need to change the corresponding information in the service file.

Run Install.sh as sudo to utilize this script

Afterwards reboot your machine, you're set.

I'll try to make this in to the extraordinary, one day.
