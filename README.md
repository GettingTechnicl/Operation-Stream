# Automateyourplex

This has only been tested on Ubuntu18.04, mileage may vary elsewhere.

This is a bash script that downloads all dependencies and installs the following applications;
Radarr, Sonarr, Deluge, Jackett, LazyLibrarian, Mylar, NzbGet, Lidarr, Ombi and sickbeard_mp4_automator.

To be added in the future are as follows;
Plex, tautulli, others I'm not thinking of right now


This script is primarily designed for my usage, although can be easily configured for usage, or utilized as a reference.


Currently none of the variables can be changed, if you change a variable you will need to change the corresponding information in the service file. 

To run the script as is simply clone this repository, make the Install.sh executable, make sure that you have a plex user created, and run the Install.sh with sudo.

Afterwards reboot your machine, and everything will be running at the respective ports.

A lot more is coming in the future.
